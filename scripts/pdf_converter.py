## 1. Context

The Moneta Network is a platform involving Membership Organizations (MOs), Publishers, and a central Moneta Core. It aims to facilitate user authentication for accessing Publisher services and manage transactions, similar to a payment network. MO users leverage an mPass (analogous to a Visa card), with private keys stored on their MO-managed mobile application and public keys in Moneta Core. The platform will operate globally.

### Current Challenges & Requirements:

#### Authentication:
Design a secure OIDC-based passwordless authentication system managed by Moneta Core, using AWS Cognito, Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway. Common flows involve users clicking a "Login with Moneta mPass" button on Publisher sites/apps, redirecting to Moneta Core's hosted UI, authenticating via their mPass mobile app (QR scan, OTP), and then being redirected back to the Publisher with OIDC tokens. The system must support session management, token revocation, refresh tokens, and SSO for publisher groups.

#### Identification:
The current UUIDv4 identifiers for MOs, Publishers, and mPasses (MO UUID + User UUID) are not human-friendly. A new coding/alias scheme is needed, supporting global scale, high availability, performance, and security.

#### Lifecycle Management:
The identifier system must support the lifecycle of MOs, Publishers (pending, destroy) and mPasses (pending, destroy, expiration, user lock, moving mPass between devices, mobile break/recovery).

#### Key Management:
An mPass should link to one active key pair and store several expired key pairs. Multiple encryption and signing algorithms need to be supported/suggested.

#### mPass Tiers:
Each mPass should be assigned a tier (e.g., Standard, Platinum). Tier information will influence policies like consumption limits and accepted debt amounts. Business flows for tier management (e.g., upgrades) are needed.

#### Billing Account Management:
mPasses, issued by MOs, need to be associated with billing accounts. Types include:

- **Individual Account:** Default; user is responsible for payments.
- **Company Account:** Multiple mPasses under one account; company owner handles payments.
- **Family Account:** Similar to Company, but one specific mPass acts as account owner, sets policies for other mPasses under the account, and is responsible for all charges.

#### Technical Stack:
Primarily AWS serverless (Cognito, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway), but open to other AWS services (S3, RDS, SNS). EKS is mentioned but serverless is preferred for this module.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
Low authentication latency, data synchronization capabilities between Moneta Core modules, extensibility for future auth methods.

#### Development & Operations:
Recommendations for Lambda development stack and CI/CD.

#### Risk Assessment:
Security risks, pros, and cons for the overall solution and specific authentication methods.

### Goals:

1. To design a robust, secure, and user-friendly OIDC passwordless authentication mechanism.
2. To propose a human-readable and manageable identification scheme for MOs, Publishers, and mPasses, incorporating tier and billing account structures.
3. To outline the technical architecture and operational considerations for these systems, ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability.

## 2. Main Use Cases

This section outlines the primary business functions addressed by this ADR, grouped by functional area.

### 2.1. Authentication Flows

This group covers how users authenticate to access publisher services and how their sessions are managed.

#### Use Cases:
- User Authenticates to Publisher via Moneta Core
- User Logs Out from Publisher
- User Experiences SSO across Grouped Publishers
- Moneta Core System Manages User Session

#### Narrative:
The primary authentication flow involves a User attempting to access a Publisher System. The Publisher System redirects the User to the Moneta Core System for authentication. The User selects a passwordless method (e.g., QR scan, OTP) and uses their mPass Mobile App to complete the challenge presented by Moneta Core. Upon successful authentication, Moneta Core issues OIDC tokens back to the Publisher System, which then grants access to the User.

Beyond the initial login, the system supports:

- **Logout:** The User can initiate a logout from the Publisher System, which communicates with Moneta Core to invalidate the session and relevant tokens.
- **Refresh Token:** Publisher Systems can use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens from Moneta Core without requiring the User to re-authenticate, maintaining a seamless experience.
- **SSO (Single Sign-On):** If a User is already authenticated with Moneta Core and accesses another Publisher System belonging to an affiliated group, Moneta Core facilitates SSO, allowing the User to access the new Publisher service without re-entering credentials.
- **Session Management:** Moneta Core is responsible for the overall lifecycle of the User's session, including creation, maintenance, and termination based on activity, token expiry, or explicit logout.

### 2.2. Partner (MO & Publisher) Management

This group covers the administrative functions for managing Membership Organizations (MOs) and Publishers on the Moneta Network.

#### Use Cases:
- Moneta Core Admin Onboards New MO
- Moneta Core Admin Views MO Details
- Moneta Core Admin Updates MO Configuration
- Moneta Core Admin Manages MO Lifecycle (e.g., Suspend, Activate, Destroy)
- Moneta Core Admin Onboards New Publisher
- Moneta Core Admin Views Publisher Details
- Moneta Core Admin Updates Publisher Configuration
- Moneta Core Admin Manages Publisher Lifecycle (e.g., Suspend, Activate, Destroy)

#### Narrative:
Partner management is primarily handled by a Moneta Core Admin interacting with the Moneta Core System.

For Membership Organizations (MOs), the Admin can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete - though 'Delete' is more accurately 'Destroy' in lifecycle terms) operations. This includes onboarding new MOs, configuring their parameters (e.g., assigning MICs, setting up communication endpoints), viewing their status and details, and managing their lifecycle (pending approval, active, suspended, destroyed). Changes in the Moneta Core System might trigger notifications or updates to the MO's own external systems.

Similarly, for Publishers, the Moneta Core Admin manages their onboarding, configuration (e.g., assigning MPCs, defining service endpoints, associating with SSO groups), viewing details, and lifecycle management. These actions ensure that only legitimate and correctly configured partners operate on the network.

### 2.3. mPass Management

This group covers the lifecycle and attribute management of individual mPasses, including their tiers and billing account associations.

#### Use Cases:
- MO Admin Issues New mPass to User
- User/MO Admin Views mPass Details
- User/MO Admin Updates mPass (e.g., user-lock, MO-initiated suspension)
- User/MO Admin Manages mPass Lifecycle (Destroy, Reactivate if applicable)
- Moneta Core System Manages mPass Expiration
- User Manages mPass Keys (implicitly, via device transfer/recovery flows)
- MO Admin Assigns/Upgrades/Downgrades mPass Tier
- MO Admin Associates mPass with Billing Account
- User (as Billing Account Owner) Manages Linked mPasses (e.g., for Family Accounts, setting policies)
- User (as Billing Account Owner) Views Consolidated Billing Information (handled by MO, Moneta Core provides data)

#### Narrative:
mPass management involves multiple actors and system interactions:

**Issuance & Lifecycle:** An MO Admin issues an mPass to a User via the Moneta Core System. The User activates and uses the mPass through their mPass Mobile App. Both the User (e.g., locking their mPass) and the MO Admin (e.g., suspending an mPass) can manage aspects of its lifecycle. Moneta Core automatically handles processes like mPass expiration.

**Key Management:** While not a direct CRUD operation by the user on keys, processes like transferring an mPass to a new device or recovering an mPass after a device break implicitly involve the generation of new key pairs on the mPass Mobile App, with the new public key being registered with Moneta Core.

**Tier Management:** The MO Admin is responsible for assigning an initial tier to an mPass and managing upgrades or downgrades based on business rules or user requests. This information is stored by Moneta Core and affects the policies applied to the mPass.

**Billing Account Management:** The MO Admin associates an mPass with a specific billing account (Individual, Company, or Family) within the Moneta Core System. For Family accounts, the designated Billing Account Owner (a User) can manage policies (e.g., spending limits) for other mPasses linked to their family account, typically via their mPass Mobile App, which then communicates these policy changes to Moneta Core.

These use cases define the core interactions for identity, access, and account management within the Moneta Network from the perspective of this ADR.

## 3. Decision

We will implement a custom OIDC passwordless authentication flow using AWS Cognito with AWS Lambda triggers for challenge management. For identifiers, we will introduce a structured, human-friendly coding scheme managed centrally by Moneta Core, alongside the existing UUIDs for internal referencing. This system will also incorporate mPass tiers and a flexible billing account structure.

### Key Components of the Decision:

#### OIDC Passwordless Authentication (Moneta Core Managed):

- **Identity Provider:** AWS Cognito User Pools will serve as the OIDC IdP.
- **Custom Authentication Flow:** Leverage Cognito's Define Auth Challenge, Create Auth Challenge, and Verify Auth Challenge Response Lambda triggers to implement passwordless methods (QR Code Scan, OTP to mPass App).
- **Hosted UI:** Cognito's Hosted UI will be customized to present these passwordless options.
- **API Gateway & Lambda:** API Gateway will expose necessary endpoints for the mPass mobile app to interact with during authentication (e.g., submit signed QR data, receive OTP instructions if not purely push-based). These will be backed by Lambda functions.
- **DynamoDB:** Used to store temporary challenge data (QR session IDs, OTP hashes), mPass public key references, and other authentication metadata.
- **Standard OIDC Features:** Session management, token revocation, and refresh token capabilities will be handled by Cognito.
- **SSO:** Cognito's native support for SSO across different app clients within the same user pool will be used for publisher groups.

#### Human-Friendly Identifiers, Tiers, Billing, & Lifecycle Management:

- **MO Code (Moneta Issuer Code - MIC):** A short, centrally assigned alphanumeric code (e.g., MOA01, 4-6 chars).
- **Publisher Code (Moneta Partner Code - MPC):** A short, centrally assigned alphanumeric code (e.g., PUBS7, 4-6 chars).
- **mPass Number:** A structured number, analogous to payment card numbers:
  - **MII (Moneta Issuer Identifier):** First 6-8 digits, globally unique, identifying the issuing MO (linked to MIC).
  - **MAI (Moneta Account Identifier):** Next 8-12 digits, assigned by the MO, unique within that MO.
  - **VC (Verification Character):** 1 character (e.g., Luhn check digit).
  - **Example:** 123456-7890123456-A.
- **mPass Tiers:** An attribute associated with each mPass (e.g., "Standard", "Platinum") influencing its policies.
- **Billing Accounts:** A separate structure to manage how mPass charges are aggregated and paid, supporting Individual, Company, and Family models.
- **Storage & Management:** These codes, tiers, and billing account associations will be stored in DynamoDB, linked to their respective UUIDs. Moneta Core will manage their lifecycle (Pending, Active, Suspended, Destroyed, Expired) via APIs and automated processes.

#### mPass Key Management:

- Each mPass will be associated with one active public key and a history of inactive (expired, superseded) public keys.
- Public keys (with algorithm identifiers) stored in Moneta Core's secure storage.
- Private keys remain solely on the user's mPass mobile app.

**Supported Algorithms:**
- **Signing:** ECDSA (e.g., P-256, P-384), EdDSA (e.g., Ed25519).
- **Encryption:** (for data at rest within Moneta Core, if needed beyond standard SSE): AES-256 GCM.

## 4. Consequences

### Pros:

✅ **Enhanced User Experience:** Passwordless methods are generally faster and more user-friendly. Human-readable codes improve operational clarity.

✅ **Flexible Financial Management:** Tier and billing account structures allow for diverse product offerings and payment arrangements.

✅ **Leverages AWS Managed Services:** Reduces operational burden for Cognito, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, ensuring scalability and reliability.

✅ **Strong Security Foundation:** OIDC is an industry standard. Custom Lambda triggers allow granular control over authentication logic. Private keys remain on user devices, reducing central risk.

✅ **Extensibility:** Cognito's custom auth flow allows adding new passwordless methods in the future. Tier and billing models can also be expanded.

✅ **Centralized Control & Consistency:** Moneta Core manages authentication, the identifier namespace, tiers, and billing account structures.

✅ **SSO Capability:** Natively supported by Cognito for publisher groups.

✅ **Global Scalability:** AWS services provide global infrastructure. DynamoDB Global Tables can be used for low-latency reads of identifier/key data if needed.

### Cons:

❗ **Increased Implementation Complexity:** Custom authentication flows, tier logic, and billing account management add layers of complexity to design, development, and testing.

❗ **AWS Ecosystem Lock-in:** Significant reliance on AWS services.

❗ **Lambda Cold Starts:** Potential for increased latency for infrequently used auth/management functions if not mitigated (e.g., provisioned concurrency).

❗ **Mobile App Dependency:** The entire passwordless flow hinges on the security and functionality of the MO's mPass mobile application, which may also need to display tier/billing info.

❗ **Data Management Overhead:** Centralized management of codes, tiers, billing accounts, and their interdependencies requires robust processes and potentially more complex data models.

### Risks & Mitigations:

#### Security Risks:

**Compromised Lambda Functions:**
- **Mitigation:** Strict IAM roles (least privilege), regular code reviews, dependency scanning, security testing (SAST/DAST), AWS WAF on API Gateway.

**Insecure Mobile App Key Storage:**
- **Mitigation:** Mandate/strongly recommend MOs to ensure private keys are stored in hardware-backed secure enclaves. Provide clear security guidelines.

**QR Code Hijacking/Replay Attacks:**
- **Mitigation:** Short-lived, single-use QR codes/session IDs. Signing of the QR challenge response by the mPass app. Secure HTTPS. User education.

**OTP Interception/Phishing:**
- **Mitigation:** Short-lived OTPs. Binding OTPs to sessions. Rate limiting. Secure delivery. User education.

**Identifier Enumeration/Guessing:**
- **Mitigation:** Avoid strictly sequential assignment. Rate limiting on lookup APIs. Strong validation.

**Unauthorized Tier/Billing Modification:**
- **Mitigation:** Strong authorization controls on APIs managing tiers and billing accounts (e.g., only MO admins or designated account owners can make changes). Audit trails for all modifications.

**Denial of Service (DoS) against Auth Endpoints:**
- **Mitigation:** AWS Shield, AWS WAF, scalable serverless infrastructure.

#### Operational Risks:

**Moneta Core Auth Module as Central Point of Failure:**
- **Mitigation:** Multi-AZ deployments. Consider multi-region for critical components.

**Identifier/Code Collision:**
- **Mitigation:** Robust central management with atomic operations or strong consistency for assigning unique codes.

**Data Synchronization Failures:**
- **Mitigation:** Reliable eventing (EventBridge) with DLQs. Monitoring. Idempotent consumers.

**Complexity in Policy Enforcement:**
Ensuring correct application of policies based on tiers and family billing account rules requires careful logic and testing.
- **Mitigation:** Thorough testing of policy logic. Clear definition of policy rules. Versioning of policies.
