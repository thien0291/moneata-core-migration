Absolutely! Here's a **brainstorming framework** to help you evaluate, design, and communicate your architectural direction ‚Äî comparing your **Old** and **New** architectures and aligning them with goals, trade-offs, and components.

# üß† Architectural Brainstorming Framework

---

## 1. üéØ **Purpose and System Context**

| Question                         | Old Architecture                        | New Architecture                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **What kind of system?**         | Domain-heavy, business logic-centric    | Event-rich, cloud-native, scalable         |
| **What‚Äôs the primary workload?** | User requests, domain orchestration     | Event processing, pipelines, automation    |
| **Who are the users/devs?**      | Internal developers (monolith-friendly) | Cloud-native teams (DevOps, microservices) |

---

## 2. üèó **Architectural Composition**

| Layer / Element        | Old (Modular Monolith + CLEAN)   | New (Serverless + Event-Driven + Pipeline)     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Unit of Logic** | Service Objects, Use Cases       | Lambdas, Pipelines, Step Functions             |
| **Orchestration**      | In-code, service methods         | EventBridge, Step Functions, async events      |
| **Eventing Mechanism** | In-process pub/sub or job queues | SNS, SQS, DynamoDB Streams, EventBridge        |
| **State Management**   | Shared memory, DB                | Stateless functions, external state (DynamoDB) |
| **Interaction Mode**   | Primarily synchronous            | Async-first, event-chained                     |
| **Code Structure**     | Modules + layers                 | Per-Lambda folders + handlers + SAM templates  |
| **Infrastructure**     | VMs, containers                  | Fully managed (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, etc.)  |

## 3. ‚öñÔ∏è **Design Trade-offs**

| Dimension         | Old Architecture                | New Architecture                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scalability**   | Limited (per monolith)          | High (per event/function)                        |
| **Deployment**    | Unified build + deploy          | Granular deploy via SAM                          |
| **Cost Model**    | Always-on compute               | Pay-per-use (cost-efficient at scale)            |
| **Observability** | Centralized logs                | Distributed tracing required (X-Ray, CloudWatch) |
| **Latency**       | Low latency (in-memory)         | Possible cold start delays                       |
| **Testability**   | Easy local testing              | Requires mocks, integration harnesses            |
| **Dev Velocity**  | High for tight domain iteration | Slower without tooling, but great long-term      |

## 4. üß∞ **Tech Stack Mapping**

| Category           | Old Stack                            | New Stack                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Framework**      | Rails, Spring, Express               | AWS Lambda, Step Functions                     |
| **Eventing Tools** | Sidekiq, ActiveSupport, pub/sub libs | SNS, SQS, EventBridge                          |
| **Storage**        | PostgreSQL, Redis                    | DynamoDB, S3                                   |
| **Deployment**     | Capistrano, Docker                   | AWS SAM, CloudFormation                        |
| **Dev Workflow**   | Local server + jobs                  | Local emulators + `sam local`, CI/CD pipelines |

## 5. üß≠ **Decision Drivers & Questions**

Use these as checkpoints when finalizing or communicating the transition:

* ‚úÖ What use cases require asynchronous event handling?
* ‚úÖ Which functions could be isolated as independent Lambdas?
* ‚úÖ What domain rules should still be encapsulated using Clean Architecture principles?
* ‚úÖ Where can we design for failure (retry, idempotency, dead-letter queues)?
* ‚úÖ Do we need orchestration (Step Functions) or just chaining via events?

## 6. üåü Guiding Principles for the New Architecture

| Principle                  | Description                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Responsibility**  | Each Lambda should handle one event/intent clearly                |
| **Stateless Design**       | No reliance on memory between invocations                         |
| **Event Contract Clarity** | Define schemas for all events (e.g., with JSONSchema or Protobuf) |
| **Composability**          | Pipelines should be flexible, swappable, and extensible           |
| **Cost Awareness**         | Use on-demand compute thoughtfully (avoid long Lambdas)           |
| **Observability**          | Add tracing + alerts early with CloudWatch Logs, X-Ray, DLQs      |

## üß© Final Wrap-Up

This framework allows you to:

* **Compare and contrast** architectural decisions.
* **Communicate design intent** to stakeholders.
* **Refactor incrementally** from monolith to serverless.
* **Preserve domain thinking** while scaling with events and pipelines.

Let me know if you'd like this in a visual **Miro board format** or a **Notion doc template** to share with your team!
